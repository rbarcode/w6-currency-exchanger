3. On the “Local” tab of the mini-window that opens underneath the “<>Code” button, copy the HTTPS link in the gray bar to your clipboard.
4. In GitBash (or a terminal shell of your choice), navigate to the directory where you wish to download the project and enter the following prompt (replacing the italicized word with the appropriate link): git clone *url-of-the-repository-copied-in-the-previous-step*
5. Your chosen directory will now contain a folder titled w6-currency-exchanger.
6. Navigate into the folder. This is the project's root directory.
7. Navigate to https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ in an internet browser and sign up for a free API key from ExchangeRate-API by inputting your email and clicking the "Get Free Key" button.
8. After creating a password and account, you'll gain access to your account's dashboard which includes your API key.
9. Activate your account by clicking on the link sent to the email address you provided at sign up. (Note: You will not be able to access the ExchangeRate-API's data with an inactive account.)
10. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project from Step 6 (you can do so by entering the following prompt in your terminal: touch .env) and add your API key to the .env file using the following convention (and replace the square brackets and the text within with your actual API key): API_KEY=[YOUR-API-KEY]
11. After ensuring you have the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js installed on your computer, run the following command from your terminal in the project's root directory: npm install  
12. Node.js' (16.13.1) packet manager, (8.1.2) npm, will fetch the packages listed in the project's package.json file and any dependencies (including webpack, ESLint and Jest) and install all of the source code in a "node_modules" directory which it creates in the project's root directory. The "scripts" key in the package.json file contains the various actions you can perform with the project's files.
13. To build the project in development mode with webpack, run the following command from your terminal in the project's root directory (and webpack will create a new directory called "dist" in your root directory and populate it with a JS file called "bundle.js" and HTML file called "index.html"): npm run build  
14. To build project and then open the webpack development server, which will launch a browser and live re-bundle and reload the project when changes are made to the code in the "src" directory, run the following command from your terminal in the project's root directory: npm run start  
15. To lint all JS files in the "src" directory using ESLint, run the following command from your terminal in the project's root directory: npm run lint
